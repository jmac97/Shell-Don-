[Shell(don) is powered by a 3.7 volt lithium battery and is controlled by a 3V Arduino Pro Trinket. A small switch turns him on and off. Nine RGB LEDs in a matrix light him up. Depending on how many times the person has tapped on Shell(don) and when, Shell(don) respond with a certain light pattern representing his mood.]
